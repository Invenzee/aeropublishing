                            Our refund and cancellation policies are designed to provide maximum security to the Client and Company both. The following terms will be applied in an event an order is cancelled unless The Book Publisher LLC cancels or terminates your contract for a reason other than breach or non-performance.
                        </p>

                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                            <li>If request for refund is made within 48 hours, you would be eligible for 100% refund (less 10% service & processing fee).</li>
                            <li>No refund request will be entertained if you have not taken any action on your order for 30 days after placing your order. However, if you want to reactivate your design order, you will be charged a certain fee depending on your project.</li>
                            <li>No refund requests will be entertained after the final files have been delivered.</li>
                            <li>For website packages no refund request will be entertained once website development has been completed or once the website has been deployed live.</li>
                            <li>For video animation packages no refund request will be entertained after the designing of the storyboard.</li>
                            <li>All refund requests should be communicated to the support department. The Book Publisher LLC, based on the violation of your user agreement reserves the right to approve/disapprove your request on an individual case to case basis.</li>
                            <li>For The Book Publisher LLC, custom packages refund will be applicable as it is on the single packages.</li>
                            <li>For example, if you order logo and web design service and approve the logo, you can claim refund for the website service at the time of initial design only.</li>
                            <li>A refund request will need to have a valid reason which must be qualified against the design brief and customer feedback for revisions. Unless a concept has not been designed according to the brief, a refund will not be given however further revisions will be provided until complete satisfaction.</li>
                            <li>Money back guarantee is based on the term that the order is placed in good faith. Where a customer has placed design orders with more than one design agency for the same job with the intention to claim refund, we do not consider it as a good faith. In such a case we reserve the right to decline a refund request.</li>
                            <li>All design jobs require customer feedback before finalizing the design therefore it is only fair that the customer gets involved and provides feedback in order to get the desired results.</li>
                            <li>100% unique design guarantee entitles you to re-draw if our designed logo is to be found considerably similar to another logo design that may already exist. Any resemblance to an existing design will be merely a coincidence and The Book Publisher LLC will not accept any responsibility or claim of any compensation in such a case. It is the client’s responsibility to get their art work copyrighted.</li>
