        question: "How long does self-publishing take?",
        answer: "The timeline for self-publishing depends on the condition of your manuscript and the services required. On average, professionally publishing a book can take anywhere from 4 to 12 weeks. This includes editing, formatting, cover design, ISBN registration, and distribution setup. If your manuscript is already finalized, the process can move faster. At Aero Publishing, we provide a clear timeline at the beginning of every project so you know exactly what to expect."

        answer: "Yes. When you publish with Aero Publishing, you retain 100% ownership of your manuscript and creative rights. You also receive the royalties generated from book sales based on the platform’s payout structure. We assist with the publishing process, but you remain the legal owner of your work at all times."
